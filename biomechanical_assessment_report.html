        When we consider range of motion, we are looking at asymmetries and deficiencies, but also how the length tension relationship affects the bone in the joint. Our gold standards are taken from various papers and research. We expect some variation from gold standard (up to 15%) but the data suggests that the closer you are to the gold standards, the less stress on the joint.

<div class="assessment-section">
    <h2>Posture Assessment</h2>
    <div class="posture-section">
        From the postural assessment we found some positive results as well as some areas we could concentrate on for improvement.<br>Your forward head posture was measured at 4.0cm (normal is deemed 0-3cm). Your thoracic (upper back) curvature was above our gold standard range, you measured 34.0 degrees, normal is considered 30-35. We saw a reduced curvature in your lumbar spine, you measured 14.0 degrees with normal being considered 30-35.<br><br> These readings indicate you have a flat back posture. A reduced curve in your lumbar spine (lower back) this can be associated with worse force absorption and transference and therefore increased loading through the joints of the spine, particularly when combined with a slightly increased forward head posture. This significant decrease in lumber curvature may lead to an increased risk of lower back pain or injury over time due to the compromised ability to distribute forces evenly across the vertebrae.<br><br>You were able to rotate your spine 70.0 degrees to the left and 69.0 degrees to the right, and could laterally flex (side bend) 60.0 degrees to the left and 55.0 degrees to the right.<br><br>The angle of pelvic tilt in quiet standing describes the orientation of the pelvis in the sagittal plane. It is determined by the muscular and ligamentous forces that act between the pelvis and adjacent segments. You were 4.5 (left) and 4.8 (right), normal is 4-7 degrees for males.

<!-- Additional Assessment Sections -->

<div class="assessment-section">
    <h2>Core Assessment</h2>
    <div class="core-section">
         Core function assessments mainly evaluate Transverse Abdominis (TVA) strength, coordination, and multifidus activation. The assessment results indicate a dominance of your Quadratus Lumborum (QL) muscles and remaining lower back musculature taking over during the lower abdominal tests, which may be due to the significantly decreased lumber curvature. This reduced curvature is likely contributing to the reduced lower abdominal strength. The Lower Abdominal Coordination Test was a fail, with no specific side noted. Your upper core bracing capabilities were not mentioned in the provided data. However, your lower core strength assessments showed reduced ability. We would like to teach you to use your deep lying core muscles, build their strength and work on their co-ordination with a large emphasis on your lower abdominals.

    <h2>Ankle Assessment</h2>

        <div class="text-content">
            
                 1. The Left foot: Your left rear foot had a centre of mass over the 2nd metatarsal which demonstrates you naturally stand in a neutral position. With your ankle in a state of dorsiflexion (knees over toes) you couldn’t evert and dorsiflex further than your resting position and as such had poor pronation. You were not able to supinate very effectively as there was little translation of this through your medial arch. Your left ankle had very poor range and strength in dorsiflexion, with plantarflexion being the only strong point. You also need to start building some more control and awareness.<br>2. The Right foot: Your right foot had a similar resting position but could access more pronation. While you were stronger on the right, there is still a need to increase your dorsiflexion force, as well as range. Your dexterity and motor control on the right was much better.<br>3. Foot and Ankle summary: Asymmetry is present with the left ankle having poor dorsiflexion range and strength, while the right ankle has good range but poor strength in both dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. What was most notable was your inability to effectively articulate the bones of the mid-foot and dorsiflex the ankle, both of which go hand in hand in the gait cycle. There is a lack of movement and control through the fascia on the sole of the foot. Subconscious movement (not controlled gym based movement but more dynamic gait cycle movements) should be introduced along with motion to promote lengthening of the tissues in your foot. In order to generate force or contract, we must first lengthen the tissue through articulation.

    <h2>Hip Assessment</h2>

                The Left hip showed sufficient but below gold standard range of motion in flexion, extension and adduction. Force production was lower than expected in all movements except internal rotation, significantly affecting hip joint integrity and movement patterns.<br><br>The Right hip showed similar range compared to the left in all movements, with an inverse relationship in the sagittal plane. The right hip was notably 25% weaker than left in extension, creating bilateral strength imbalances affecting pelvic alignment.<br><br>Hip summary: Significant reduction in hip extension range of motion compromises pelvic stability. Hip extension helps stabilise the pelvis and when range of motion and strength are poor this influences proper alignment of the lower limb. Hip extension strength is essential for propulsion and preventing excessive back extension, leading to inefficient movement patterns and increased injury risk.<br><br>Large deficits in internal rotation range and strength affect functional capacity. Internal rotation in closed & open-chain movements plays important roles in squatting and deadlifting activities. Having range and strength here is vital for maintaining hip joint integrity and stability. The flexor mechanism also plays a role in force transmission from hip muscles to the lower limb and ultimately to the ground. Optimising internal rotation mechanics will allow for more efficient energy transfer during both closed and open-chain movements. It's necessary to reduce the current asymmetry present at the hip.

    <h2>Shoulder Assessment</h2>

        <div class="text-content">
            
                 The Left Shoulder had a greater range of motion in internal rotation and slightly higher external rotation compared to the gold standard. However, it showed notable reductions in force for all movements tested, particularly in internal rotation and flexion.<br><br>The Right Shoulder had a notably larger range of motion in external rotation but less so in internal rotation when compared to the left. The right shoulder was weaker in external rotation but stronger in internal rotation force when compared to the left.<br><br>Shoulder Summary: Your transverse plane range is biased towards external rotation, which is mirrored on the hip side. However, your right shoulder has a significant dominance in external rotation force, while the left shoulder shows a notable reduction in all tested forces. This asymmetry needs to be addressed through targeted programming and progressive overloading of the areas of weakness, particularly the left shoulder's internal rotation and flexion. Additionally, soft tissue work and scapula mobility exercises may help improve the right shoulder's internal rotation range.
