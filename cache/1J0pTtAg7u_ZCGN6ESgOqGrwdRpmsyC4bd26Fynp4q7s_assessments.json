  "posture": "From the postural assessment we found some positive results as well as some areas we could concentrate on for improvement.<br>Your forward head posture was measured at 4.0cm (normal is deemed 0-3cm). Your thoracic (upper back) curvature was above our gold standard range, you measured 34.0 degrees, normal is considered 30-35. We saw a reduced curvature in your lumbar spine, you measured 14.0 degrees with normal being considered 30-35.<br><br>These readings indicate you have a flat back posture. So where your forward head posture is slightly increased we could expect increased levels of force and tension being applied to the discs and muscles of your cervical and thoracic spine (neck and upper back). A significantly reduced curve in your lumbar spine (lower back) this can be associated with worse force absorption and transference and therefore increased loading through the joints of the spine.<br><br>You were able to rotate your spine 70.0 degrees to the left and 69.0 degrees to the right, and could laterally flex (side bend) 60.0 degrees to the left and 55.0 degrees to the right.<br><br>The angle of pelvic tilt in quiet standing describes the orientation of the pelvis in the sagittal plane. It is determined by the muscular and ligamentous forces that act between the pelvis and adjacent segments. You were 4.5 (left) and 4.8 (right), normal is 4-7 degrees for males. ",
  "core": "The core function assessments primarily evaluate TVA strength, coordination, and multifidus activation. Your results indicate a significant decrease in lumbar curvature, which is likely contributing to the observed reduction in lower abdominal strength. <br><br>The Lower Abdominal Coordination Test was passed, suggesting that you have some level of coordination in this area. However, both your upper core and lower core assessments indicate that bracing capabilities are not functioning efficiently. This may suggest a reliance on compensatory patterns, potentially involving the quadratus lumborum (QL) and other lower back musculature, which may be taking over during core stabilization tasks.<br><br>To address these issues, we would like to teach you to use your deep lying core muscles, build their strength, and work on their coordination with a larger emphasis on your lower abdominals.",
  "ankle": "The Left foot: Your left foot is positioned in a neutral alignment, with the center of mass appropriately over the 2nd metatarsal. However, it is unable to pronate, indicating a restriction in the subtalar joint's motion. Dorsiflexion range and strength are both poor, which may limit your ability to effectively absorb forces during dynamic activities. In contrast, plantarflexion exhibits good range but lacks strength, suggesting a need for targeted strengthening exercises, particularly through overcoming isometrics to enhance stability and control.<br><br>The Right foot: The right foot also maintains a neutral position with the center of mass over the 2nd metatarsal, but it demonstrates the ability to pronate, indicating a more functional subtalar joint. While dorsiflexion range and strength are similarly poor as on the left, the right foot shows good range and strength in plantarflexion, highlighting a disparity in muscle performance between the two feet.<br><br>Foot and Ankle summary: There is notable asymmetry between your feet, particularly in the ability to pronate and the strength of the plantarflexors. The left foot's inability to pronate and poor dorsiflexion strength contrasts with the right foot's functional capabilities. To address these discrepancies, we recommend focusing on building strength in the left foot through isometric exercises, while also enhancing proprioception and control. Incorporating dynamic movements that promote awareness of foot positioning and midfoot articulation will be beneficial for both feet, particularly in improving overall foot function and stability during activities.",
  "knee": "The Left knee achieved poor range in flexion, 28% below our gold standard, and was also weak in this area, showing a 32% deficit in strength (distal hamstring). Despite these deficits, the left knee demonstrated sufficient range in extension, only 6% below the gold standard, although it was still weak in extension with a 41% deficit in strength. The hamstring to quadriceps ratio on the left side was classified as good, indicating a relatively balanced strength between the hamstrings and quadriceps.<br><br>The Right knee also exhibited poor range in flexion, 26% below the gold standard, but was stronger than the left knee in both range and strength, with a 2.8% stronger flexion and a 16% deficit in strength (distal hamstring). In extension, the right knee showed sufficient range, 8% below the gold standard, and was slightly weaker than the left knee with a 42% deficit in strength. The right knee's hamstring to quadriceps ratio was classified as high, reflecting strong hamstring strength compared to the quadriceps.<br><br>Knee summary: Both knees show significant deficits in flexion range and strength, necessitating focused rehabilitation efforts in this area. While the left knee has a good hamstring to quadriceps ratio, the right knee's high ratio indicates a need for balance in strength development. Overall, enhancing flexion peak force and addressing strength imbalances in both knees will be crucial for improving knee function and stability.",
  "hip": "The Left hip showed sufficient range in flexion but with a large deficit in extension, abduction, and internal rotation. Strength was significantly compromised across all movements, particularly in flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and internal rotation, which negatively impacts movement patterns and hip joint integrity. The notable asymmetry with the right side indicates a substantial imbalance that could affect overall stability and function.<br><br>The Right hip demonstrated a sufficient range in flexion and extension but had a large deficit in abduction and internal rotation. While it performed better in external rotation, strength deficits were still present bilaterally across all movements. The right side's superior range in external rotation contrasts with the left's deficits, further emphasizing the asymmetry and its potential impact on propulsion and force production during activities.<br><br>Hip summary: The significant deficits in hip extension and internal rotation on the left side compromise pelvic alignment and overall hip joint integrity. The strength deficits across both hips, particularly in flexion and internal rotation, hinder effective propulsion and energy transfer during movement. The large asymmetries, especially in internal rotation, highlight the need for targeted interventions to improve range and strength, which are crucial for maintaining stability and efficient movement patterns. Addressing these deficits will be essential for optimizing hip function and reducing the risk of injury.",
  "shoulder": "The Left Shoulder demonstrated a strong capacity for both external and internal rotation, with both ranges exceeding the gold standard. However, there was a notable reduction in external rotation force, indicating a significant weakness in this area. The internal rotation force was also considerably reduced, suggesting a need for targeted strengthening. Flexion range was slightly above the gold standard, but force output was notably reduced, indicating potential issues with functional strength during overhead movements.<br><br>The Right Shoulder exhibited a greater range of external rotation compared to the left, but internal rotation was significantly weaker. The right shoulder's external rotation force was also reduced, though less so than the left. Internal rotation force was notably reduced, with a greater deficit compared to the left shoulder. Flexion range was good but below the gold standard, and while the force output was reduced, it was less than that of the left shoulder, indicating a slight advantage in functional strength.<br><br>Shoulder Summary: There are notable asymmetries between the shoulders, particularly with the left shoulder showing significant weaknesses in external and internal rotation forces, while the right shoulder has a greater range of external rotation but reduced internal rotation strength. To address these issues, a focus on progressive overcoming isometrics for both internal and external rotation, along with scapula mobility and shoulder mobilisation drills, is recommended. Additionally, incorporating unilateral movements to enhance strength and balance between the shoulders will be beneficial for overall shoulder health and function.",
  "overall_conclusion": "Our results indicate you have a flat back posture. This posture is characterized by a reduction in the natural lumbar curve, which can lead to a flattening of the thoracic spine and a subsequent depression of the rib cage. This positioning often results in the shoulders being held back and in a more retracted position, which can affect the overall alignment of the pelvis. The pelvis may exhibit a tendency towards internal rotation, which can further complicate the dynamics of your posture. Addressing these postural elements will be crucial for improving your overall alignment and function.<br><br>There are significant compensations occurring at the hip, particularly in your propulsion strategies during gait and closed-chain movements. The limitations in internal rotation and extension on the left side suggest that you may be relying on alternative strategies to generate forward propulsion. This can lead to overuse of the spine to compensate for the lack of hip function, which may contribute to discomfort or inefficiency during movement. Additionally, enhancing awareness of mid-foot pressurization will be essential to improve your force transfer and overall stability.<br><br>Our approach will focus on improving the range of motion at the hip while ensuring proper integration with the knee and ankle. By enhancing tissue loading patterns and joint articulation, we can optimize muscle contraction quality and address any force discrepancies present. This will help to alleviate undue stress on the spine and improve overall movement efficiency. Targeted exercises will be implemented to facilitate better hip function and coordination with the lower extremities.<br><br>To enhance the efficiency of your shoulder girdle, we need to focus on the mechanics of the ribcage and scapula. Implementing a resistance training approach that includes heavy isometrics and eccentrics will be beneficial, particularly after performing fascial release work. Emphasizing the deltoids and rotator cuff complex will help to improve stability and strength in the shoulder region, ultimately leading to better overall upper body function and alignment."
