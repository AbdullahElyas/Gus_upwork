  "posture": "From the postural assessment we found some positive results as well as some areas we could concentrate on for improvement.<br>Your forward head posture was measured at 3.3cm (normal is deemed 0-3cm). Your thoracic (upper back) curvature was above our gold standard range, you measured 50.0 degrees, normal is considered 30-35. We saw an increased curvature in your lumbar spine, you measured 38.0 degrees with normal being considered 30-35.<br><br>These readings indicate you have a sway back posture. So where your forward head posture is slightly increased we could expect increased levels of force and tension being applied to the discs and muscles of your cervical and thoracic spine (neck and upper back). An increased curve in your lumbar spine (lower back) this can be associated with worse force absorption and transference and therefore increased loading through the joints of the spine.<br><br>You were able to rotate your spine 39.0 degrees to the left and 38.0 degrees to the right, and could laterally flex (side bend) 38.0 degrees to the left and 31.0 degrees to the right.<br><br>The angle of pelvic tilt in quiet standing describes the orientation of the pelvis in the sagittal plane. It is determined by the muscular and ligamentous forces that act between the pelvis and adjacent segments. You were 6.0 (left) and 8.0 (right), normal is 4-7 degrees for males. ",
  "core": "The core function assessments primarily evaluate TVA strength, coordination, and multifidus activation. Your slightly increased lumbar curvature is likely contributing to the observed reduction in lower abdominal strength. This curvature can lead to compensatory patterns, where the lower back musculature may dominate during core stabilization tasks, potentially affecting overall core function.<br><br>As we focus on your core strength, it is essential to address these compensatory patterns and work on enhancing the strength and coordination of your deep core muscles. We would like to teach you to use your deep lying core muscles, build their strength and work on their coordination with a larger emphasis on your lower abdominals.",
  "ankle": "The Left foot: Your left foot is positioned in a slightly everted state, with the center of mass located between the 1st and 2nd metatarsals. Notably, the foot exhibits limited pronation capabilities, indicating a potential restriction in the subtalar joint's mobility. Dorsiflexion demonstrates good range; however, strength in this movement is poor, which may affect overall stability and control. Similarly, plantarflexion shows good range but also lacks strength, necessitating a focus on overcoming isometric challenges to enhance muscle engagement and awareness.<br><br>The Right foot: The right foot mirrors the left in its slightly everted position, with the center of mass also between the 1st and 2nd metatarsals. However, it differs in that it can pronate effectively, suggesting a greater capacity for dynamic movement and adaptability. Both feet exhibit comparable ranges in dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, yet both struggle with strength, indicating a bilateral weakness that requires attention.<br><br>Foot and Ankle summary: There is noticeable asymmetry between the two feet, particularly in the ability to pronate, which may influence overall gait mechanics. While both feet demonstrate similar everted positioning and range of motion, the left foot's limitations in pronation could lead to compensatory patterns during movement. It is crucial to prioritize strength training, particularly through isometric exercises, to enhance control and stability in both feet. Additionally, incorporating dynamic awareness activities, such as balance exercises and proprioceptive training, will aid in improving fascial control and overall foot function.",
  "knee": "The Left knee achieved sufficient range in both flexion and extension, with both ranges being 11% and 2% below our gold standard, respectively. However, the left knee demonstrated poor strength in flexion, being 57% below the gold standard, which is significantly weaker compared to the right knee. The hamstring to quadriceps ratio on the left side is classified as poor, indicating a need for improvement in the distal hamstring strength to enhance overall knee stability.<br><br>The Right knee also showed sufficient range in both flexion and extension, matching the left knee's performance. However, the right knee exhibited better strength in both flexion and extension, being 37% and 18% below the gold standard, respectively. This results in a stronger right knee compared to the left, with a hamstring to quadriceps ratio that is also classified as poor, but slightly lower than the left side.<br><br>Knee summary: Both knees demonstrate sufficient range but significant deficits in strength, particularly in the left knee. There is a critical need to focus on improving the strength of the distal hamstrings and quadriceps to enhance the hamstring to quadriceps ratio, which is poor on both sides. Addressing these strength deficits will help in reducing joint stress and improving overall knee function.",
  "hip": "The Left hip showed excellent range in hip flexion and extension, exceeding the gold standard. However, significant strength deficits in flexion, abduction, adduction, and both internal and external rotation compromise overall hip joint integrity and movement patterns. The notable asymmetry in flexion indicates a potential imbalance affecting propulsion and force production.<br><br>The Right hip demonstrated similar range capabilities, particularly in hip flexion and extension, also above the gold standard. Despite this, it exhibited large deficits in strength for flexion, abduction, and adduction, which may hinder effective propulsion. The right side's strength in external rotation was sufficient but still below the gold standard, indicating room for improvement.<br><br>Hip summary: The substantial strength deficits on both sides, particularly in flexion and abduction, impact pelvic alignment and overall movement efficiency. The left hip's deficits in internal rotation are particularly concerning, as they present a significant asymmetry that affects hip joint stability and function. The inverse relationship in range of motion highlights the need for targeted interventions to optimize femur positioning and enhance energy transfer during both closed and open-chain movements. Addressing these deficits is crucial for improving overall hip function and reducing the risk of injury.",
  "shoulder": "The Left Shoulder exhibited excellent external rotation, with both sides performing equally above the gold standard. However, there was a notable reduction in internal rotation, indicating a significant weakness in this area. Additionally, the left shoulder showed a notable reduction in extension, which further contributes to its functional limitations. Flexion was good but still below the gold standard, indicating some room for improvement.<br><br>The Right Shoulder also demonstrated equal external rotation compared to the left, maintaining a strong performance above the gold standard. Internal rotation was notably stronger than the left, but still below the gold standard, indicating a good capacity but with some deficits. Flexion was slightly better than the left, though still below the gold standard, while extension was notably reduced, though less so than the left shoulder.<br><br>Shoulder Summary: The assessment reveals that both shoulders have strong external rotation capabilities, but there are significant weaknesses in internal rotation and extension, particularly in the left shoulder. To address these deficits, a focus on progressive overcoming isometrics for internal rotation and extension is recommended, along with shoulder mobilisation drills to enhance overall range and function. Incorporating unilateral movements will also help to balance the strength and improve the asymmetries noted in both shoulders.",
  "overall_conclusion": "Our results indicate you have a sway back posture. This is characterized by an exaggerated lumbar curve which can lead to a forward displacement of the pelvis and rib cage depression. This posture often results in the shoulders being positioned further back, creating an externally rotated position. The pelvis may also exhibit a loss of internal rotation, which can affect overall movement patterns. Addressing this posture with specific correctives will be essential to improve rib cage dynamics and overall alignment, as it can have significant consequences during gait.<br><br>There are notable compensations occurring at the hip, particularly with propulsion strategies during gait and closed-chain movements. The left hip shows a range deficit, while the right hip has limitations in adduction and internal rotation. These restrictions can hinder effective hip extension, leading to over-reliance on the spine for generating downward force. This suggests a need to enhance awareness of mid-foot engagement and pressurizing through the ground to improve overall force transfer during movement.<br><br>Our approach will focus on increasing range of motion at the hip and ensuring proper integration with the knee and ankle. By improving joint articulation and muscle contraction quality, we can address the force discrepancies observed. This will involve targeted exercises to enhance tissue loading efficiency, ensuring that key areas are not overloaded and that movement patterns are optimized for better performance.<br><br>To enhance the efficiency of your shoulder girdle, we need to address the mechanics of the rib cage and scapula. A combination of heavy isometrics and eccentrics, following fascial release work, will be beneficial. Emphasizing the deltoids and rotator cuff complex will help improve stability and strength in the shoulder joint, ultimately leading to better overall function and movement quality."
