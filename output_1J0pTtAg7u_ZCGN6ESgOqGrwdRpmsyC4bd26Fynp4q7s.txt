From the postural assessment we found some positive results as well as some areas we could concentrate on for improvement.
Your forward head posture was measured at 4.0cm (normal is deemed 0-3cm). Your thoracic (upper back) curvature was above our gold standard range, you measured 34.0 degrees, normal is considered 30-35. We saw a reduced curvature in your lumbar spine, you measured 14.0 degrees with normal being considered 30-35.

 These readings indicate you have a flat back posture. A reduced curve in your lumbar spine (lower back) this can be associated with worse force absorption and transference and therefore increased loading through the joints of the spine, particularly when combined with a slightly increased forward head posture. This significant decrease in lumber curvature may lead to an excessive amount of stress being placed on the lower back muscles and discs, potentially leading to discomfort or injury over time.

You were able to rotate your spine 70.0 degrees to the left and 69.0 degrees to the right, and could laterally flex (side bend) 60.0 degrees to the left and 55.0 degrees to the right.

The angle of pelvic tilt in quiet standing describes the orientation of the pelvis in the sagittal plane. It is determined by the muscular and ligamentous forces that act between the pelvis and adjacent segments. You were 4.5 (left) and 4.8 (right), normal is 4-7 degrees for males.
