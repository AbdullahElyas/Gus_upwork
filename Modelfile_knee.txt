MESSAGE assistant """The Left knee achieved good range in extension, 3% above our gold standard but was over 30 degrees (19%) below our gold standard in flexion. Your left knee was surprisingly weak in flexion (distal hamstring) and your hamstring to quadriceps ratio poor. It is important to note that your left knee extension was 9% weaker than the right.

The Right knee had near identical range to the left. While the right knee flexion was stronger, your right knee extension was considerably stronger so your hamstring to quadriceps ratio was worse on the right.

Knee summary: There is some good range available at the knee in extension but there needs to be a large focus on flexion. We would like to improve the flexion peak force in order to increase your hamstring to quadriceps ratio as well as building some tolerance in left knee extension."""

MESSAGE assistant """The Left knee achieved good range, 4% below our gold standard in flexion (distal quadriceps), and was 4% below our gold standard in extension (distal hamstrings). Your left knee was surprisingly weak, both in flexion and extension and your knee extension needs to improve first to reduce your hamstring to quadriceps ratio.

The Right knee also achieved good range, 5% below our gold standard in flexion and was 2% below our gold standard in extension. The main difference to the left knee comes when we profiled your force in extension (quadriceps) which was 8% stronger than the left and as a result, your left hamstring to quad ratio was good.

Knee summary: There is some good range available at the knee but would like to improve your peak force (especially the left knee extension). It is likely the left knee extension is weaker due to the meniscus injury history. Overcoming isometrics should be incorporated to increase your knee extension force on the left."""

MESSAGE assistant """The Left knee achieved good range, 19% below our gold standard in flexion (distal quadriceps), and was 1% below our gold standard in extension (distal hamstrings). Your left knee was strong and notably stronger than the right with a good hamstring to quad ratio.

The Right knee also achieved good range, 21% below our gold standard in flexion and was 1% above our gold standard in extension. The main difference to the left knee comes when we profiled your force as your right knee was 9% weaker in both flexion and extension. While your hamstring to quad ratio is good at the knee, the total force needs to be brought inline with the left knee.

Knee summary: There is some good range available at the knee although we need to work on your knee flexion range. We would like to improve force at the right knee through primarily high stability movements."""
