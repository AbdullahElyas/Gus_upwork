From the postural assessment we found some positive results as well as some areas we could concentrate on for improvement.
Your forward head posture was measured at 6.3cm (normal is deemed 0-3cm). Your thoracic (upper back) curvature was above our gold standard range, you measured 55.0 degrees, normal is considered 30-35. We saw a reduced curvature in your lumbar spine, you measured 25.0 degrees with normal being considered 30-35.

 These readings indicate you have both a forward head posture and kyphosis. So where your forward head posture is increased we could expect increased levels of force and tension being applied to the discs and muscles of your cervical and thoracic spine (neck and upper back). A reduced curve in your lumbar spine (lower back) this can be associated with worse force absorption and transference and therefore increased loading through the joints of the spine.

You were able to rotate your spine 37.0 degrees to the left and 38.0 degrees to the right, and could laterally flex (side bend) 28.0 degrees to the left and 29.0 degrees to the right.

The angle of pelvic tilt in quiet standing describes the orientation of the pelvis in the sagittal plane. It is determined by the muscular and ligamentous forces that act between the pelvis and adjacent segments. You were 4.0 (left) and 6.0 (right), normal is 4-7 degrees for males.
