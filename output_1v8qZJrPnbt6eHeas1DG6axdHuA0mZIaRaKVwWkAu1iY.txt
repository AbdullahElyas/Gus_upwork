From the postural assessment we found some positive results as well as some areas we could concentrate on for improvement.
Your forward head posture was measured at 3.8cm (normal is deemed 0-3cm). Your thoracic (upper back) curvature was above our gold standard range, you measured 30.0 degrees, normal is considered 30-35. We saw a reduced curvature in your lumbar spine, you measured 26.0 degrees with normal being considered 30-35.

 These readings indicate you have a flat back posture. A reduced curve in your lumbar spine (lower back) this can be associated with worse force absorption and transference and therefore increased loading through the joints of the spine.

You were able to rotate your spine 48.0 degrees to the left and 49.0 degrees to the right, and could laterally flex (side bend) 44.0 degrees to the left and 51.0 degrees to the right.

The angle of pelvic tilt in quiet standing describes the orientation of the pelvis in the sagittal plane. It is determined by the muscular and ligamentous forces that act between the pelvis and adjacent segments. You were 6.0 (left) and 6.0 (right), normal is 7-10 degrees for females, showing your posterior tilt and matches the findings of a reduced lumbar curvature as the lumbar spine directly articulates with the sacrum and its joints with the pelvis.
