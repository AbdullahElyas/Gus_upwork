MESSAGE assistant """The Left hip showed large range deficits scoring well below our gold standard in flexion and internal rotation. There was significant strength deficits in flexion, abduction and external rotation affecting hip joint integrity.

The Right hip showed similar range compared to the left in all movements, with an inverse relationship in the sagittal and frontal plane. The inverse relationship in range of motion highlights femur positioning changes. Force production was better than left, with largest difference being 9.6% reduction in hip extension.

Hip summary: Hip extension strength deficits significantly compromise propulsion and pelvic alignment. When range of motion and strength are poor this influences proper alignment and movement patterns. Hip extension is essential for propulsion and force transmission to the ground.

The large internal rotation range deficits suggest joint restrictions limiting optimal positioning during functional movements. Combined with external rotation strength deficits, this creates movement pattern dysfunction that compromises hip joint integrity and energy transfer. The flexor mechanism also plays a role in force transmission from hip muscles to the lower limb. Optimising internal rotation mechanics will improve energy transfer during both closed and open-chain movements. It's necessary to reduce the current deficiencies present at the hip."""

MESSAGE assistant """The Left hip showed great range with only slight deficit in hip extension. Force production showed much greater deficits with flexion, adduction and extension in the lowest percentiles affecting movement patterns and hip joint integrity.

The Right hip showed similar range of motion to the left side. While stronger on average, there was notable reduction in force production in flexion, extension and adduction compromising propulsion capacity.

Hip summary: The notable reduction in hip extension range of motion on the left affects pelvic alignment. Hip extension helps stabilise the pelvis and when range of motion and strength are poor this influences proper alignment of the lower limb. Hip extension strength is essential for propulsion and preventing excessive back extension, which leads to inefficient movement patterns.

Large asymmetries and inverse relationship in rotation affect hip joint integrity. Internal rotation in closed & open-chain movements plays important roles in squatting and functional activities. Having range and strength here is vital for maintaining hip joint stability. The flexor mechanism also plays a role in force transmission from hip muscles to the lower limb and ground. Optimising rotation mechanics will allow for more efficient energy transfer during both closed and open-chain movements. It's necessary to reduce the current asymmetry present at the hip."""

MESSAGE assistant """The Left hip showed large range deficits with three movements scoring well below our gold standard. Force production was lower than expected in all movements except internal rotation, significantly affecting hip joint integrity and movement patterns.

The Right hip showed similar range compared to the left in all movements. The right hip was notably 22% weaker than left in abduction, creating bilateral strength imbalances affecting pelvic alignment.

Hip summary: Significant reduction in hip extension range of motion compromises pelvic stability. Hip extension helps stabilise the pelvis and when range of motion and strength are poor this influences proper alignment of the lower limb. Hip extension strength is essential for propulsion and preventing excessive back extension, leading to inefficient movement patterns and increased injury risk.

Large deficits in external rotation and flexion strength affect functional capacity. External rotation in closed & open-chain movements plays important roles in squatting and deadlifting activities. Having range and strength here is vital for maintaining hip joint integrity and stability. The flexor mechanism also plays a role in force transmission from hip muscles to the lower limb and ultimately to the ground. Optimising external rotation mechanics will allow for more efficient energy transfer during both closed and open-chain movements. It's necessary to reduce the current asymmetry present at the hip."""
